If you're using this in a commercial environment:

1. You need an engineer that knows what they're doing, not whatever I'm doing here.
2. Stop using this immediately and conduct your own testing with your own funding.
3. Seek help.

If you're not using this in a commercial environment, do whatever you want with this.
